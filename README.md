# time-shooter
A sh'mup written in Pygame, with a small twist.

Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your ship, space to shoot, and either shift to slow down time for everything but your ship.

Right now, 'q' spawns enemies that shoot at set intervals, and 'e' increments your score.

Still very much a work in progress.
